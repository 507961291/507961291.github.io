                <h3>Target Audience</h3>
                <h4>Description</h4>
                Middle aged, professional Idahoans who stay active and informed to assist them 
                in decision making and sound leadership. Although this is a strictly family-friendly 
                site, the audience is adults. Generally, they are leaders in the workplace and in 
                the home. They are breadwinners and are resposible for, not only their families, but
                their community as a whole, also.
                <h4>Personas</h4>
                <h5>Forest Conservationist Tim</h5>
                Tim has been working with the US Forest Service since he was 18. He's only a few 
                years shy of his 20th workiversary. He leads projects in trail development and 
                maintenance, taking into consideration various efforts to protect and revive native 
                plant and wildlife species. Before heading out on the trail, Tim corresponds with 
                his team and receives orders from regional directors from the US Forest Service 
                office. He will likely check the conditions from his desktop workstation.
                <h6>Scenarios:</h6>
                <ol class="scenarios">
                    <li>Tim needs to create a detour after a recent fire has devastated a highly 
                        trafficed route. He visits Idaho Weather Site to see if there has been rain in the 
                        area over the last 48 hours or expected in the next week, as he would like 
                        to build a temporary bridge for the detour.</li>
                    <li>Tim will act as docent for some visiting biologists who are curious about 
                        the a specific type of endangered falcon. Tim checks Idaho Weather Site to find out 
                        the moisture levels of the air. He wants to make sure the fog doesn't 
                        interfere with their visibility.</li>
                    <li>Tim heard that a nearby storm has taken an unexpected turn and will be 
                        interfering with a renaturalization project he hoped to have completed 
                        before a new group is expected to be camping in the area. He checks 
                        Idaho Weather Site to see if he has enough time to complete his project, 
                        or if he should call the camp event off. </li>
                </ol>
                <h5>Equestrian Endurance Rider Rachel</h5>
                Rachel is in her 40s and owns and runs a barn where local community members or 
                visitors can board their horses. Horse people who wish to explore this region of 
                Idaho can rent horses and a trail guide to explore the wilderness by horseback as 
                a day trip. Weather conditions will dictate the routes taken. Rachel likes to talk 
                and make plans, but isn't one to sit at a desk. She will likely check the site 
                from her mobile phone.
                <h6>Scenarios:</h6>
                <ol class="scenarios">
                    <li>
                        Rachel has a group of local riders and their support crews getting ready 
                        for a week long trip out of state to ride in a 100 Mile Edurance Race together. 
                        She checks Idaho Weather Site to determine when the ideal times to go on community 
                        bonding trail rides.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Rachel is showing her barn to a family who is new to the area and having their 
                        house built. They would like to board their horse whlie their house is being built. 
                        Rachel wants it to be a highly accessible time for the family to see her 
                        accomodations.
